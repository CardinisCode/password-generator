# password-generator


My to-do:
- Write the password generator 
(Will require user interaction: Ask user for words, numbers and characters and it will feedback a random password.)
- Create a user interface - where user can decide what they want to do / how they want to use the program
(Desired result: user will only have access to the questions and then to the info they requested specifically)
- Store the passwords in txt file
- Encrypt the passwords txt file & have a decrypter as well (for when the user requests certain info)
- Secure the python source code for the project so its not accessible to the outside world (or atleast the code regarding the encryption process)
(possibly Binary encryption)
